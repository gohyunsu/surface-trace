# Lower change-alert limit: fixed extended-run result

The candidate MMD limit was fixed at **75% of the original source limit**
after inspecting the missed development join. It passed the five-run
[development gate](CHANGE_LIMIT_DEVELOPMENT.md), which was committed before
the sixteen extended recordings were scored. The same DINOv2 global features,
MMD windows, 32-frame step, and three-window confirmation rule were retained.
No defect labels enter either change signal.

| Known-boundary comparison | Original limit | 75% trial limit |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Development joins alerted | 4 / 5 | **5 / 5** |
| Extended joins alerted | 15 / 16 | **16 / 16** |
| Median delay on alerted extended joins | 96 frames | 96 frames |
| Alerts before the known join, extended recordings | 0 | 0 |
| Confirmed alerts on 16,518 later frames of the source recording | 0 | 0 |
| Source-continuation windows above limit | 0 / 513 | 2 / 513 |

The previously missed extended join, `T1_S177_I108_1`, now confirms an
alert at new-run frame 192. Two other extended joins alert earlier:
`T1_S148_I108_1` moves from frame 224 to 192, and `T1_S174_I108_1`
from frame 288 to 192. The remaining thirteen retain their original first
alert. Both over-limit windows on the long source continuation are isolated;
the longest streak is one, below the required three.

Every recomputed original alert matched the earlier saved result exactly.
The candidate was applied to all sixteen extended recordings; none was
discarded for a late or missing alert. Machine-readable windows and scores
are in [`results/change_limit_final.json`](results/change_limit_final.json).

### Why a shorter source-only sequence limit is insufficient

As a post-hoc diagnostic, split the 513 saved source-continuation score windows
into the first 256 and last 257. The highest *minimum of three consecutive
scores* in the first part is 0.026023; a strict `score > limit` rule at that
value has no three-window alert there by construction. In the later part of
the **same recording**, the corresponding maximum is 0.041361, and the
early-part limit would first confirm an alert at absolute frame 10,496
(72 later windows exceed it). The 75% trial limit is 0.047945 and does not
confirm an alert in this recording. These figures come from
[`results/source_continuation_full.json`](results/source_continuation_full.json)
using windows `[0:256]` for the probe limit and `[256:513]` for the later
check. There are no annotated within-recording change times, so the
10,496-frame signal is an **unexplained within-run alert**, not a verified
false alarm. This probe did not set or revise the 75% factor.

### Post-hoc margin around the 75% trial

For a three-window confirmation rule, let `M` be the largest minimum of any
three consecutive saved scores. A limit below `M` produces a confirmed alert.
The 16,518-frame source continuation has `M = 0.041361`, or **0.647** of the
original source limit. Among the known joins, the smallest after-join `M` is
`0.051104` (**0.799** of the original limit) in development and `0.055040`
(**0.861**) in the extended set. The fixed 0.75 trial therefore sits between
the source-continuation alert boundary and the weakest observed join. Its
margin to the weaker development join is only about **0.049** of the original
limit. These values are calculated from the saved score arrays in
[`results/source_continuation_full.json`](results/source_continuation_full.json),
[`results/change_limit_development.json`](results/change_limit_development.json),
and [`results/change_limit_final.json`](results/change_limit_final.json).

This is a retrospective sensitivity diagnostic, not a new threshold choice.
It does not replace the additional independently calibrated continuity checks
in [`CHANGE_STABILITY_PROTOCOL.md`](CHANGE_STABILITY_PROTOCOL.md).

**Interpretation.** This fixed rule improves sensitivity on the measured
joins between existing recordings without increasing *confirmed* alerts on
the one long source continuation. It does not identify the true time of an
unannounced within-recording process change, and it does not establish a
field false-alert rate. The 75% factor was chosen using a known development
join, while these public recordings had also been inspected for other
project questions. The result is a follow-up sensitivity check, not an
untouched external test. Keep the originally source-calibrated limit as the
active site result until broader stable-run and partner-camera controls can
assess the lower limit.

Protocol and code: [CHANGE_LIMIT_PROTOCOL.md](CHANGE_LIMIT_PROTOCOL.md),
[`change_limit_trial.py`](change_limit_trial.py). The fixed candidate was
committed as `4ed4a68` and the passed development gate as `9bcb342` before
the extended run.
