# Additional within-run change controls

The [fixed stability protocol](CHANGE_STABILITY_PROTOCOL.md) tested two more
4,096-frame TSFabrics recordings with no published defect labels. Each
recording was calibrated independently on its first 2,048 frames, then scored
on frames 2,112–4,095. A confirmed alert requires three consecutive
over-limit windows. This is a diagnostic reset, not the active source detector
running across an unannounced production switch.

| Recording | Current limit: windows over / longest streak / first alert | 0.75× trial: windows over / longest streak / first alert |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `T1_S177_I108_1` | 1 / 1 / none | 3 / 2 / none |
| `T2_S466_I39_1` | 29 / 6 / frame 3,264 | 59 / 59 / frame 2,304 |

Each continuation has 1,984 frames and 59 score windows. Both have zero
published defect and ambiguous labels. The second recording produced a
confirmed within-run change alert with either limit; lowering the limit moved
that alert earlier and increased the number of over-limit windows. A
defect-free label does not establish that its appearance or process stayed
constant, so this is an **unexplained within-run alert**, not a verified false
alarm. The two recordings do not justify promoting the lower limit. The active
limit remains unchanged.

The original source continuation's 16,518 later frames had no confirmed alert
under the current limit. That single source result therefore does not describe
within-run stability across other settings. The new control is also post-hoc;
an annotated within-run change benchmark is still needed to distinguish useful
shift alerts from nuisance alerts.
